# libtree

A tool that:
- :deciduous_tree: turns `ldd` into a tree
- :point_up: explains how shared libraries are found or why they cannot be located

## Output

By default, certain standard dependencies are not shown. For more verbose output use

-  `libtree -v`             Show libraries skipped by default
-  `libtree -vv`            Show dependencies of libraries skipped by default
-  `libtree -vvv`           Show dependencies of already encountered libraries

Use the `--path` or `-p` flags to show paths rather than sonames:

- `libtree -p $(which tar)`
